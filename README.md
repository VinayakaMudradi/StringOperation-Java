# StringOperation-Java

Define the following terms:

Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows: A<B<C.......a<b<.....<z.
For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.

A substring of a string is a contiguous block of characters in the string. For example, the substrings of abc are a, b, c, ab, bc, and abc.
Given a string, S , and an integer, K, complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length K.
